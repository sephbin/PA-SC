Browser-based modelling point out a future for the AEC industry. Yet at present no literature review nor a taxonomy of browser-based modelling platforms exist. A key outcome of a unique taxonomy framework of existing BMA characteristics reveals that current BMAs do not take full advantage of the web's unique capabilities such as centralising data across multiple tools within an 'ecosystem'. Consequently, this taxonomy has productively guided the development of Redback BIM, a proof-of-concept BMA that enables the coordination of BIM data in a collaborative online context. Redback BIM further demonstrates how, through establishing a universal data-type, a diverse range of scripts can be consolidated together in an online platform to enable greater accessibility for a range of AEC professionals towards improved project communication and efficiency."},{"name":"Redback BIM - Developing 'De-Localised' Open-Source Architecture-Centric Tools","publisher":"Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA)","releaseDate":"2018","website":"http://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/paper/caadria2018_122","summary":"Emerging technologies that use data have contributed to the success of communication all over the world. Social media and gaming industries have already taken advantage of the web to provide synchronous communication and updated information. Conversely, existing methods of communication within the AEC industry require multiple platforms, such as emails and file sharing services in conjunction with 3D Modelling software, to inform changes made by stakeholders, resulting in file duplication and limited accessibility to the latest version, while augmenting existing practice's inefficiency. As communication is critical to the success of a project and should be enhanced, Redback BIM promises to establish a workflow for a dynamic platform, while achieving similar results to that of a 3D modelling program hosted on the web. Using existing open-source web development software, multiple users will be able to collaboratively organise and synchronise changes made to the design scheme in real-time. Features such as this would enable more fluid communication between multiple stakeholders within the life of a project."},{"name":"Urban Pinboard - Establishing a Bi-directional Workflow Between Web-based Platforms and Computational Tools","publisher":"Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA)","releaseDate":"2017","website":"http://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/paper/caadria2017_027","summary":"Architecture is heading towards a future where data is collected, collated and presented in a dynamic platform. There is a potential for many standard processes in the industry to become automated, such as the site analysis process. Streamlining aspects of the design process allows architects to pay greater attention on creative design solutions for their buildings and less time engaging in complex, time consuming analytical programs. Urban Pinboard, a web-based GIS platform, promises to establish a bi-directional workflow between web data depositories and computational tools through the medium of a website. By doing so, the website allows users with minimal experience in computational processes to be engaged in the utilisation of these large datasets. Through the automation of these processes, relationships within the built environment industry can excel, leading towards performative driven designs."},{"name":"Optimisation for Sport Stadium Designs","publisher":"Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA)","releaseDate":"2015","website":"papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/paper/caadria2015_054","summary":"Applying computational optimisation tools for sport stadium designs has become common practice. However, optimizations often occur only on a macro level (analysing stadium as a whole) and not on a micro level (a view from each seat). Consequently, items on a micro level with design details like guardrails can be overlooked, leading to financial losses for operators. Hence, the research argues that every seat is encouraged to have a clear field of view to avoid financial complications. In order to address this problem the research team developed and evaluated a script that allowed importing an existing design into Rhino. Firstly, the script evaluates the view of each seat via a colour coded response system. Secondly, the designer can select the respective seat, and view the sightline from the occupantâ€™s sightline to various spots on the field to analyse where the obstruction is occurring. This â€˜binocular viewâ€™ enables the designer to evaluate blind spots from each seat prior to project completion. As the script allows the designer to automate the micro level analysis, the research arguably provides a significant improvement for stadium design by comparing the time used for a design optimisation in a conventional method with the automated one."}],"skills":[{"name":"Rhino and Grasshopper","level":"Master","keywords":["parametric modeling","advanced trees","project managment","robust coding"]},{"name":"Python","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["django","gh python"]},{"name":"Revit and Dynamo","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["automation","interoperability","coordination"]},{"name":"Architecture","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["sport","urban planning","urban design","transport - rail","transport - water","transport - air","exhbition and convention","structural resolution"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker"},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Beginner"}],"interests":[{"name":"Travel","keywords":["Language","Food","Culture"]},{"name":"Technology","keywords":["R&D","Concepts","Prototyping"]}],"references":[{"name":"John Ferendinos","reference":"Cox Director"},{"name":"Dr Hank Matthias","reference":"UNSW Program Director"},{"name":"Danny Nguyen","reference":"Colleague, Co Co-Founder"}]}}
