Use it with impaling, piercing, or cutting attacks that are carriers for Afflictions or Innate Attacks (usually those that inflict fatigue or toxic damage) with the Follow-Up modifier (p. 105); this represents small poison darts, stings, etc. that can slip through armor without inflicting grievous wounds.\n"}, {"title": "Damage Modifiers", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "The attack irradiates the subject. Roll damage normally, but whether or not the attack penetrates DR, it inflicts 1 rad per point of basic damage rolled. See Radiation (p. 435) for effects. For a toxic attack, this dosage is instead of regular damage, and the enhancement is worth +25%; this is typical of \"ordinary\" radioactivity. For a burning attack, the radiation dose is as well as regular damage, and the enhancement is +100%; use this for particle beams. Other damage types cannot have this enhancement."}, {"title": "Delay", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "This enhancement delays the attack's effects until sometime after you hit the target.

To keep PCs from granting each other free advantages, the GM may wish to forbid this level of Extended Duration on Afflictions with the Advantage modifier."}, {"title": "Extra Recoil", "modifier": "-10% per +1 Recoil", "body": "By default, a ranged attack has Recoil 1, making it virtually recoilless (see p. 271).

Only its carrier attack may have them."}, {"title": "Guided or Homing", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Homing: Your attack steers itself. Decide how it seeks its target: with ordinary vision or a sensory advantage such as Detect (p. 48), Infravision (p. 60), Night Vision (p. 71), Scanning Sense (p. 81), or Vibration Sense (p. 96). The attack uses this sense for the purpose of combat modifiers; e.g., radar ignores darkness but can be jammed. To \"lock on,\" you must Aim at the target and make an unmodified skill roll. Do not roll against your skill to hit. Instead, use the attack's skill of 10 - plus Accuracy, if you made your skill roll - and ignore all range penalties. Homing costs a base +50%, plus 1% per point the chosen homing mechanism would cost if bought as an advantage (without any modifiers); e.g., Infravision costs 10 points, making Homing (Infravision) +60%. Ordinary vision uses the base +50%."}, {"title": "Inaccurate", "modifier": "-5%/level", "body": "Your attack benefits little from careful aiming. Most attacks start with Accuracy (Acc) 3. Each -1 to Acc is a -5% limitation. You may not reduce Acc below 0.\n"}, {"title": "Increased Range", "modifier": "+10%/level", "body": "If applied to a ranged attack, each level increases 1/2D and Max. You may increase 1/2D or Max individually at half cost (that is, \"Increased 1/2D\" and \"Increased Max\" are +5%/level). However, you cannot increase 1/2D past Max. At most, you can make 1/2D equal to Max - this means the attack has no 1/2D range. For attacks that already have no 1/2D range, you can increase Max for +5%/level.\n"}, {"title": "Jet", "modifier": "+0%", "body": "Your attack is a continuous stream, like a flamethrower. Treat it as a melee weapon with a very long reach rather than as a ranged weapon. Do not apply penalties for target range and speed."}, {"title": "Limited Use", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Slow Reload: As above, except if you have two or more shots (not uses!) you must reload each shot individually (taking 3 or more seconds per shot). If you have only one shot, it must take at least 6 seconds to reload - possibly longer, if using this limitation to represent a very slow-firing weapon such as a flintlock. This makes the limitation worth 5% less than usual; e.g., three or four uses would be worth only -15%.\n"}, {"title": "Link", "modifier": "+10% or +20%", "body": "You can use two or more advantages simultaneously, as if they were a single ability. For +10%, your abilities are permanently linked into a single power, and must be used together - you cannot use them separately. For +20%, you can also use them separately. You must add this enhancement to all the abilities you wish to link."}, {"title": "Low or No Signature", "modifier": "+10% or +20%", "body": "An attack normally has a \"signature\": a flash of light, a sound, etc. If left unspecified, this is assumed to be similar to a gunshot or a stroke of lightning - that is, a brilliant flash and a loud report. This enhancement makes your attack less obvious."}, {"title": "Malediction", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "When enhancing an Affliction, the Quick Contest above replaces the usual resistance roll. You roll against Will, but your target rolls against HT - or other attribute, if the attack has Based on (Different Attribute) - modified as usual for the Affliction. For instance, an Affliction that allows a HT-1 roll to resist would result in a Quick Contest of your Will vs. the target's HT-1."}, {"title": "Melee Attack", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Your attack functions as a melee weapon. It has no range, but allows you to parry, use Rapid Strike, Feint, etc. It lacks Malf., 1/2D, Max, Acc, RoF, Shots, and Recoil statistics, and may not have any enhancement or limitation that modifies these statistics. Instead, it has a Reach statistic."}, {"title": "Mitigator", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Example 2: Jan has AIDS, and would die in a month without treatment. This level of Terminally Ill is normally worth -100 points. Fortunately, Jan is on an experimental drug plan that is holding him in remission. The treatments are weekly (-65%) but impossible to find outside his program (+10%), for a -55% Mitigator limitation. This reduces Terminally Ill to -45 points. As long as Jan stays with the program, his countdown to death is halted.\n"}, {"title": "Mobile", "modifier": "+40%/level", "body": "To move the area of effect, you must take a Concentrate maneuver. To make the mobile area autonomous, add Homing (which causes it to attack the nearest valid target) and possibly Selective Area (so it only seeks out enemies).

The GM must approve this limitation and determine its value in each case, and should ruthlessly forbid effects that are abusive or that do not genuinely limit the ability's value. A few guidelines (a given trait can have more than one of these drawbacks):"}, {"title": "Onset", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "A variant limitation is Exposure Time, which is only available for attacks with Aura or Persistent. Use it to represent radioactivity, mildly toxic gases, etc. It works just like Onset, except that the victim must be exposed for the entire period to suffer the effect (or repeat it, if you continue exposure). This is worth an extra -20%; e.g., 1 minute is -30%.\n"}, {"title": "Overhead", "modifier": "+30%", "body": "Your attack can alter its angle to strike from a different side of the target - usually the top. This bypasses any cover that does not provide overhead protection, and negates attack penalties to hit crouching, kneeling, sitting, or prone targets. (If you are already above or below your target, adjust this appropriately.) Use this to represent a rain of fire, a missile that swoops up and then dives down at the last moment, an airburst grenade, etc.\n"}, {"title": "Pact", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "A Higher Power - god, spirit, etc. - grants your ability under the condition that you follow a strict moral code. This code must take the form of one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). These disadvantages give you the usual number of points. Should you ever stray from the path, your ability immediately ceases to function until you repent.

Use Extended Duration to increase the duration.\n"}, {"title": "Preparation Required", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "You can use a prepared ability normally - either immediately or at a later time. However, you can only have one advantage with this limitation prepared at a time, and it becomes unprepared immediately after use, regardless of success or failure (but if your ability has continuing effects, you can maintain them once activated)."}, {"title": "Ranged", "modifier": "+40%", "body": "This enhancement gives range to an advantage that normally affects your immediate area, or that requires a touch to affect others. By default, it has 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. Duration is 10 seconds, unless the ability lists another duration (like Neutralize or Possession) or is instantaneous (like Healing), and you cannot use the ability again until all existing effects have worn off. You can apply other modifiers to change the ranged combat statistics and duration."}, {"title": "Rapid Fire", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Multiple Projectile: Each shot splits into multiple projectiles after you attack, like a shotgun blast or forked lightning. Express this as a multiplier following RoF; for instance, RoF 3x4 means each of three shots fired divides into four individual projectiles. Modifier cost is based on the RoF times the multiplier; e.g., RoF 3x4 costs the same as RoF 12."}, {"title": "Reduced Fatigue Cost", "modifier": "+20%/level", "body": "You may only take this enhancement for abilities that cost FP, and never in conjunction with the special modifier \"Usually On.\" You can take it any number of times. Each level cuts the cost to use the ability by 1 FP.

You may not reduce Max independently.\n"}, {"title": "Reduced Time", "modifier": "+20%/level", "body": "You may only add this enhancement to abilities that require time to activate. You can take it any number of times. Each level halves the time required to use the ability (round up). Once time is reduced to one second, a further level of Reduced Time makes the ability instantaneous - using it is a free action."}, {"title": "Resistible", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "This limitation is only available for Innate Attacks that inflict fatigue or toxic damage. You must combine it with one of Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Follow-Up, Respiratory Agent, or Sense-Based. It represents poison, disease, or a similar effect that a sufficiently healthy victim can resist or \"shrug off.\""}, {"title": "Respiratory Agent", "modifier": "+50%", "body": "Your attack must be inhaled to have any effect, but it ignores all DR. Only Doesn't Breathe and Filter Lungs protect completely - although a victim who makes a Sense roll to notice the attack in time may hold his breath (see Holding Your Breath, p. 351).

For instance, a Vision-Based attack cannot affect a blind subject or someone with his eyes closed, while a Smell-Based attack doesn't work underwater or on a target with a gas mask. Advantages (such as Protected Sense, p. 78) and equipment that protect the sense in question either negate the attack completely or, in the case of attacks that allow a roll to resist (such as Afflictions, Maledictions, and Resistible attacks), give a bonus to the resistance roll."}, {"title": "Side Effect", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "Choose the side effects from the effects described for Affliction (p. 35). Valid choices are stunning, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, and Incapacitation. The cost of Side Effect is a base +50%, plus the cost of the Affliction enhancements.

It is unavailable during the recharge period. Value depends on the time between uses: five seconds (or twice the time required to use the ability, if longer) is -10%, 15 seconds (or 5 times the time required to use the ability, if longer) is -20%, and one hour (or 10 times the time required to use the ability, if longer) is -30%. Longer recharge times are not valid as limitations (but see Limited Use, p. 112).\n"}, {"title": "Temporary Disadvantage", "modifier": "Variable", "body": "You may only take Temporary Disadvantages that could logically inconvenience you for the period of time the advantage is normally on.
