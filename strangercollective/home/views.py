		skills = [{"title":"Accounting","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6, Finance-4, Mathematics (Statistics)-5, or Merchant-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to keep books of account, to examine the condition of a business, etc. A successful Accounting roll (requires at least two hours of study, and possibly months to audit a large corporation) can tell you whether financial records are correct, and possibly reveal evidence of forgery, tampering, and similar criminal activity"},{"title":"Acrobatics","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"","body":"This is the ability to perform gymnastic stunts, roll, take falls, etc. This can be handy on an adventure, as tightrope walking, human pyramids, and trapeze swinging all have useful applications. Each trick requires a separate skill roll, at whatever penalties the GM sees fit. If you are performing stunts on a moving vehicle or mount, roll against the lower of Acrobatics and the appropriate Driving or Riding skill"},{"title":"Acting","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5, Performance-2, or Public Speaking-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: +1 for every point of IQ you have over the person you are trying to fool (or the smartest one in the group), or -1 for every point of difference if your victim is smarter than you; -3 for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 to -4 for Shyness (p. 154); -5 for Truthfulness (p. 159), but only if you are trying to deceive someone. For impersonation only: -5 if you are not well acquainted with your subject; -5 if those you wish to fool are acquaintances of the subject (-10 for close acquaintances)."},{"title":"Administration","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Merchant-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the skill of running a large organization. It is often a prerequisite for high Rank (p. 29). A successful Administration roll gives you a +2 reaction bonus when dealing with a bureaucrat, and allows you to predict the best way to go about dealing with a bureaucracy"},{"title":"Alchemy","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the study of magical transformations and transmutations. In a magical game world, an alchemist would be able to identify concoctions with magical effects (\"elixirs\"), such as love potions and healing unguents, and prepare them from suitable ingredients. This is a mechanical process, using the mana inherent in certain things; therefore, those without Magery can learn and use Alchemy, and Magery confers no benefit"},{"title":"Animal Handling","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to train and work with animals. You must specialize in a category of animals - the more intelligent the animals, the narrower the category. Examples of interest to adventurers: Big Cats (jaguars, lions, tigers, etc.), Dogs, Equines (horses and donkeys), and Raptors (eagles, falcons, and hawks). The default between specialties is -2 within the same order (e.g., Dogs to Big Cats), -4 across orders (e.g., Dogs to Equines), and -6 for larger differences (e.g., Dogs to Raptors)"},{"title":"Anthropology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6, Paleontology","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the science of evolution and culture. An anthropologist is knowledgeable in the ways of primitive (and not-so-primitive) societies. An Anthropology roll might explain, or even predict, unusual rituals and folk customs. This skill requires specialization by species (if left unspecified, assume the anthropologist's own species). Specialties usually default to one another at -2 to -5, although there may be no default for completely alien species"},{"title":"Archaeology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the study of ancient civilizations. An archaeologist is at home with excavations, old potsherds, inscriptions, etc. An Archaeology roll lets you answer questions about ancient history, or identify artifacts and dead languages. It might even reveal information relating to the occult; e.g., Ancient Secrets and Things Man Was Not Meant To Know . . "},{"title":"Architecture","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Engineer (Civil)-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to design buildings, and to deduce the design of buildings from their function (and vice versa). A successful Architecture roll lets you learn things about a strange building, find a secret room or door, etc"},{"title":"Area Knowledge","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"IQ-4 or Geography","prerequisites":"None.","body":"The GM should not require Area Knowledge rolls for ordinary situations; e.g., to find the blacksmith, tavern, or your own home. But he could require a roll to locate a smith to shoe your horse at 3 a.m., or to find the best ambush spot along a stretch of road. \"Secret\" or obscure information might give a penalty, require a Hidden Lore skill (p. 199), or simply be unavailable - GM's decision. For instance, Area Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives you the location of the Russian Embassy, but not the KGB's current safe house"},{"title":"Armoury","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Engineer (same)- 4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Most specialties default to one another at -4 - but above TL4, there is no default between Armoury specialties dealing with armor and Armoury specialties dealing with weapons.

Artillery (Cannon) covers both 81mm infantry mortars and 406mm naval guns, but going from one to the other will give -2 for weapon type (81mm vs. 406mm), -2 for fire-control (visual spotting vs. fire-direction center), and -2 for mount (bipod vs. naval turret), for a total of -6 to skill until you familiarize yourself with all the differences"},{"title":"Artist","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Artist is based on IQ, but there are many situations in which the GM could logically ask for a DX-based roll, in which case modifiers for High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham- Fisted (p. 138) would apply. In rare cases, even a ST-based Artist roll might make sense - for instance, to work with a physically tough material"},{"title":"Astronomy","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the study of stars and other extraplanetary objects. An astronomer could answer questions about the Sun, the planets of the solar system, etc. An amateur who can locate stars and use a telescope, but not perform involved calculations, has an optional specialty (p. 169): Astronomy (Observational). This specialty does not require Mathematics as a prerequisite"},{"title":"Beam Weapons","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Easy","prerequisites":"None.","body":"These specialties default to one another at -4. Treat specific beam types (blaster, laser, stunner, etc.) as familiarities. Other modifiers are as per Guns (p. 198). In settings with both beam and projectile weapons, the Pistol and Rifle specialties of Beam Weapons default to the similarly named Guns specialties at -4, and vice versa"},{"title":"Bicycling","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"DX-4 or Driving (Motorcycle)-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to ride a bicycle long distances, at high speeds, in rallies, etc. Roll at +4 if all you want to do is struggle along without falling off.

You must specialize:"},{"title":"Biology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"IQ-6 or Naturalist-6.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"At TL6+, most biologists have an optional specialty (p. 169) as well. The most common options are biochemistry (the study of the chemical reactions that sustain life), botany (the study of plants), ecology (the study of environments), genetics (the study of heredity and genomes), marine biology (the study of ocean life), microbiology (the study of microscopic organisms), and zoology (the study of animals), but more obscure specialties are possible"},{"title":"Blind Fighting","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"Trained By A Master or Weapon Master.","body":"Modifiers: Background noise gives a penalty: -1 for rain, -2 for heavy rain or a storm, -3 for a crowded, noisy area or heavy machinery, -4 for a full football stadium, or -5 in the middle of an artillery barrage. If you cannot hear at all, the roll is at -7, but you may still attempt a roll, as the skill is not completely based on hearing. Add your level of Acute Hearing to the roll. Add the higher of your ESP Talent (p. 256) or Telepathy Talent (p. 257)."},{"title":"Blowpipe","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to use a blowpipe.

To do so, you must first roll against Poisons (or Alchemy, Pharmacy, etc., as appropriate) to identify the poison. You cannot attempt this roll until you know you have been poisoned. In most cases, you only discover this when the first symptoms show! A successful Body Control roll - adjusted by any modifier to the HT roll to resist the poison - flushes the poison in 1d hours, after which it has no further effect"},{"title":"Body Language","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Average","defaults":"Detect Lies-4 or Psychology-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to interpret a person's facial expressions and body posture in order to gauge his feelings. You can use it like the Empathy advantage (p. 51) or Detect Lies skill (p. 187), but only on a subject you can see. You can also use it to get a rough idea of what a party member is doing or about to do in a situation where he cannot communicate with you directly (for instance, when using Stealth). You can only observe one subject at a time"},{"title":"Body Sense","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"DX-6 or Acrobatics-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to adjust quickly after teleportation or similar \"instant movement.\" A successful roll lets you act normally on your next turn. A failed roll means disorientation: you may take no action other than defense for one turn. A critical failure means you fall down, physically stunned!"},{"title":"Bolas","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to throw the bolas: a length of cord with two or more weights attached. Its primary uses are to stop herd animals and to hunt small game, but it can also entangle opponents in combat. See Special Ranged Weapons (p. 410) for bolas rules"},{"title":"Bow","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to use the longbow, short bow, and all similar bows. It also covers the compound bow, although a person who had never seen a compound bow would suffer a -2 unfamiliarity penalty"},{"title":"Boxing","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"When you defend with bare hands, Boxing allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Boxing parries are at -2 vs. kicks and -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks. Boxing also gives an improved retreating bonus when you parry; see Retreat (p. 377). For more on barehanded parries, see Parrying Unarmed (p. 376)"},{"title":"Brainwashing","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Special.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Brainwashing encompasses many techniques - some proven, others little better than witchcraft. Depending on the setting, these might include drugs, electroshock, hypnotism, sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, social pressure, subliminal messages, or surgery . . . and most likely a combination of several of these"},{"title":"Brawling","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"When you defend with bare hands, Brawling allows you to parry two different attacks per turn, one with each hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. Brawling parries are at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting attacks.

Camouflage will not improve your Stealth roll, but if you fail a Stealth roll while camouflaged, those who heard you must still see through your camouflage to see you"},{"title":"Carousing","attribute":"HT","challenge":"Easy","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the skill of socializing, partying, etc. A successful Carousing roll, under the right circumstances, gives you a +2 bonus on a request for aid or information, or just on a general reaction. A failed roll means you made a fool of yourself in some way; you get a -2 penalty on any reaction roll made by those you caroused with. If you do your carousing in the wrong places, a failed roll can have other dangers!"},{"title":"Carpentry","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Easy","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to build things out of wood.

It provides a Defense Bonus (+1 if light, +2 if heavy) and gives a Block defense equal to (skill/2) + 3, rounded down. A cloak is not as robust as a shield, though! A light cloak has only DR 1 and 3 HP, while a heavy cloak has DR 1 and 5 HP"},{"title":"Combat Art or Sport","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Varies","defaults":"Special.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Combat Art and Sport skills are DX-based, with the same difficulty level and defaults as the corresponding combat skill. A combat skill, its Art form, and its Sport form default among themselves at -3. For instance, Staff Art and Staff Sport are DX/Average skills that default to DX-5, just like Staff skill (p. 208). A fighter with Staff at 15 would have default Staff Art and Staff Sport skills of 12, while an athlete with Staff Sport at 15 would have Staff and Staff Art skills at 12 by default"},{"title":"Computer Hacking","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill is cinematic, and simulates the way computer intrusion works in many movies and novels.

Individuals from settings without computers cannot even use it by default until they have had time to gain familiarity with computers! In settings where it is possible to \"jack\" your brain into a computer, Computer Operation includes the ability to use a neural interface, but new users initially suffer a -4 penalty for unfamiliarity (see Familiarity, p. 169)"},{"title":"Computer Programming","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: -2 or more for an unfamiliar programming language (see Familiarity, p. 169). The time modifiers under Time Spent (p. 346) will often apply. When writing a program that deals with a specialized field of knowledge, the GM may require a roll against the lower of Computer Programming and your skill in that field (e.g., a Mathematics specialty for a complex mathematical program, or the lower of Teaching skill and a \"subject\" skill for an expert system that will assist users with a particular subject)."},{"title":"Connoisseur","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 and others.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill represents an educated understanding of art and luxury items. It is vital to art dealers, critics, master thieves, and anyone who wishes to appear cultured.

Many chefs have an optional specialty (p. 169), such as baking, beverage making, or a particular variety of ethnic cuisine (e.g., Chinese or Martian)"},{"title":"Counterfeiting","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6 or Forgery-2.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"An ordinary success means that your work is good but not perfect. Whenever you try to pass the counterfeit money, the GM makes a second skill roll for you, with all the same modifiers. If this roll fails, the recipient spots your handiwork. To successfully pass bogus currency to someone who has reason to be suspicious, you must win a Quick Contest of Counterfeiting vs. the highest of his Perception, Forensics, and Merchant"},{"title":"Crewman","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Easy","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill also lets you steer the vessel. It is easier than Piloting, Submarine, and similar skills because it only includes knowledge of how to steer. Specialists handle such activities as plotting courses and operating sensors. These experts report to the captain, who in turn tells you how to maneuver. Make a DX-based skill roll whenever you take the helm - but note that your effective skill cannot exceed your captain's Shiphandling skill (p. 220)"},{"title":"Criminology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Psychology-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the study of crime and the criminal mind.

A computer with appropriate software gives a bonus (provided you know Computer Operation skill): +1 for a home computer, +2 for a minicomputer, +3 or +4 for a mainframe, and +5 or more for a supercomputer. The code-breaker is at +5 if he has a sample of the code with translation, and -5 if the message to be decoded is shorter than 25 words. The codemaker receives a bonus for the time taken to create the code: consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550), look up the time in days in the Range/Speed column (substituting \"days\" for \"yards\"), and use the corresponding bonus."},{"title":"Current Affairs","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"IQ-4 or Research-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"On a successful Current Affairs roll, the GM will inform you of any news within your specialty that pertains to the current adventure (possibly including clues, on a good roll) or give you a small skill bonus (e.g., a success on Current Affairs (Sports) might give +1 to Gambling skill when betting on a boxing match)"},{"title":"Dancing","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Exotic dances abound in fiction and history: blade dancing, bull dancing, fire dancing, snake dancing, etc. The GM may decide that each is a separate DX/Average skill that defaults to Dancing-5"},{"title":"Detect Lies","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Perception-6, Body Language-4, or Psychology-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to tell when someone is lying to you. It is not the same as Interrogation (p. 202); Detect Lies works in a casual or social situation. When you ask to use this skill, the GM rolls a Quick Contest of your Detect Lies skill vs. your subject's IQ (or Fast-Talk or Acting skill). If you win, the GM tells you whether the subject is lying. If you lose, the GM may lie to you about whether you were lied to . . . or just say, \"You can't tell.\""},{"title":"Diagnosis","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6, First Aid-8, Physician-4, or Veterinary-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to tell what is wrong with a sick or injured person, or what killed a dead person. A successful roll gives some information about the patient's problem - limited to realistic knowledge for your tech level. It might not determine the exact problem (if the GM feels the cause is totally beyond your experience, for instance), but it always gives hints, rule out impossibilities, etc. No Diagnosis roll is required for obvious things, like open wounds and missing limbs!"},{"title":"Diplomacy","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6 or Politics-6.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Unlike other Influence skills, Diplomacy never gives a worse result than if you had tried an ordinary reaction roll. Failure with Fast-Talk or Sex Appeal alienates the subject, but Diplomacy is usually safe"},{"title":"Disguise","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Makeup-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345). +4 for Elastic Skin (p. 51). You are at -1 to -5 to disguise yourself as someone very different from you (GM's discretion). Distinctive appearance also gives a penalty - see Build (p. 18), Unnatural Features (p. 22), and specific disadvantages (e.g., Hunchback, p. 139) for details. Differences in Size Modifier usually make Disguise impossible."},{"title":"Dreaming","attribute":"Will","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"A Dreaming roll can also help you recall a previously forgotten piece of information, or something you witnessed but did not consciously note. This technique is much less reliable than Eidetic Memory (p. 51), though. The GM will describe your dreams to you, working clues into the narrative. It is up to you, the player, to spot these hints!"},{"title":"Driving","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"Defaults:","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: -2 or more for bad driving conditions; -2 or more for a vehicle in bad repair; -2 for an unfamiliar control system (e.g., an automatic when you are used to a manual); -4 or more for a vehicle of an unfamiliar type within your specialty (e.g., a race car when you are used to stock cars)."},{"title":"Dropping","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"DX-3 or Throwing-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the skill of dropping heavy objects on your foes while flying.

It is mainly an academic skill, but a successful skill roll allows you to predict the economic impact of events in the game world: the assassination of a political figure, the demolition of a power plant, the introduction of a new invention, etc. Adventurers with intelligence and military backgrounds frequently have some training in this skill"},{"title":"Electrician","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Engineer (Electrical)-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the skill of building, maintaining, and repairing electrical systems.

These specialties default to one another at -4"},{"title":"Engineer","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Defaults:","prerequisites":"","body":"Note that engineers are designers and inventors; they are not necessarily skilled at the routine operation or maintenance of the things they design! For instance, Engineer (Small Arms) lets you design a new assault rifle, but you need Armoury skill to maintain it and Guns skill to shoot it"},{"title":"Enthrallment","attribute":"Will","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"Charisma 1 and Public Speaking at 12+.","body":"At the outset of the tale, roll vs. Public Speaking skill; if you can't grab your audience's attention early on, you won't have much of a chance of controlling them by the end. On a success, proceed to the Enthrallment skill roll; critical success gives +1 on that roll. On a failure, you may still attempt the Enthrallment roll, but at a penalty equal to your margin of failure. Critical failure means your Enthrallment attempt fails automatically"},{"title":"Environment Suit","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"DX-5 and others.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"When rolling against DX or any DX-based skill while suited up, use the lower of your Environment Suit skill and your actual skill level. For instance, if you have DX 14, Stealth- 15, and Vacc Suit-13, you will function at DX 13 and Stealth-13 while wearing a spacesuit. Particularly ungainly suits might give -1 or more to DX on top of this, regardless of skill level. On the other hand, some sleek, ultra-tech suits might not limit skills at all!"},{"title":"Erotic Art","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"DX-5 or Acrobatics-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This represents general knowledge of advanced sexual technique. IQ-, HT-, and even ST-based rolls are common. Precise game effects are left to the GM's discretion"},{"title":"Escape","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"The GM may apply a penalty for particularly secure bonds. For instance, modern police handcuffs would give -5 to Escape. You suffer only half these penalties if you dislocate the restrained limb (usually an arm). This requires (20 - skill) minutes of concentration, minimum one minute and a Will roll. However, if you fail your Escape roll by 3 or more when dislocating a limb, the limb suffers 1d damage. On a critical failure, you automatically take enough damage to cripple the limb!"},{"title":"Esoteric Medicine","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"The effectiveness of Esoteric Medicine relative to Physician (p. 213) is up to the GM. It might be more effective (especially if it can channel real supernatural power), equivalent but different, or less effective. It should always be at least as good as First Aid (p. 195) - the attentions of a trained healer of any kind are preferable to bleeding to death! In TL5+ settings, Esoteric Medicine is often perceived as \"quack\" medicine, regardless of actual effectiveness"},{"title":"Exorcism","attribute":"Will","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Will-6, Religious Ritual (any)-3, Ritual Magic (any)-3, or Theology (any)-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"If the spirit wins or ties, it retains its current status and you must wait at least a week before you can repeat the ritual.

Default: Shortsword-3"},{"title":"Mental Strength","attribute":"Will","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"Trained By A Master or Weapon Master*.","body":"You can actively focus your mind to resist mental attacks. This skill replaces Will when you resist magic spells, psi powers, Hypnotism, Invisibility Art, Kiai, and similar abilities. Mental Strength does not replace most normal Will rolls.

A good roll might provide insights into phenomena that aren't related to known powers. However, Occultism provides no details on how talented individuals invoke their powers.

Roll once per jump. Failure could mean anything from drifting off course to panic that makes you drop your gear (GM's option). A critical failure means the chute did not open or was fatally fouled (see Falling, p. 431). For a jump under bad conditions, make a second roll on landing - for instance, to survive an \"ankle-breaker\" landing without injury, or to dodge trees on the way down. Make an IQ-based roll to pack a parachute"},{"title":"Parry Missile Weapons","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill lets you parry thrown or missile weapons with a ready melee weapon.

A successful skill roll lets you mix drinks, recall local laws regarding alcohol, gauge the intoxication level of a customer, or calm an unruly drunk before the bouncer needs to get involved.

Roll swing damage for that ST, and double the result. For instance, if you had ST 10 and Push-15, you would roll swing damage for ST 15 (2d+1), and double it.

If you know this skill at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST whenever you make or resist a grapple or takedown, and whenever you attempt to break free, and +1 per die to your damage when you slam or shove. These bonuses increase to +2 if you know Sumo at DX+2 or better"},{"title":"Surgery","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"First Aid-12, Physician-5, Physiology-8, or Veterinary-5.","prerequisites":"First Aid or Physician.","body":"Modifiers: Equipment modifiers (p. 345); physiology modifiers (p. 181); -3 if the area or equipment cannot be properly cleaned and sterilized; -3 for head or chest surgery; -5 for undiagnosed problems. If you lack Physician skill, you are at -5 to do anything but \"field-expedient\" surgery (e.g., stitch wounds or extract arrowheads, bullets, and shrapnel)."},{"title":"Survival","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Average","defaults":"Perception-5 or Naturalist (same planet)-3.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"In settings where it is possible to visit other worlds, you must also specialize by planet. Each Survival specialty defaults to the same terrain type for a different planet at -4. The defaults between terrain types given above are at an extra -4 between different planets. All this assumes the two planets are of the same planet type (see Planet Types, p. 180). There is no default at all between Survival skills for two planets of different planet types"},{"title":"Swimming","attribute":"HT","challenge":"Easy","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the skill of swimming (whether on purpose or to keep afloat in emergencies) and lifesaving. Roll against the higher of Swimming or HT to avoid fatigue while swimming or injury due to aquatic misfortunes. When racing someone of equal water Move, roll a Quick Contest of Swimming to determine the winner. See Swimming (p. 354)"},{"title":"Symbol Drawing","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Special.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"In traditions where magical power flows from the caster, nature, spirits, etc. as opposed to the symbols themselves, the symbols provide a focus that aids magic use. Roll against Symbol Drawing before each ritual. On a success, add half your margin of success (round down) to your skill with the next ritual you conduct over the symbols. This kind of Symbol Drawing defaults to Ritual Magic (same)-4. For instance, Symbol Drawing (Voodoo) defaults to Ritual Magic (Voodoo)-4, and lets you draw the vevers used in Voodoo ritual"},{"title":"Tactics","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6 or Strategy (any)-6.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"When commanding a small unit, roll against Tactics to place your troops correctly for an ambush, know where to post sentries, etc. At the GM's option, a successful roll might even provide clues as to immediate enemy plans. To outmaneuver enemy units, you must win a Quick Contest of Tactics with their leader. All of this only applies when you lead a group small enough that you can give each warrior orders personally - or through at most one subordinate. Thus, radio and similar technologies can greatly enhance your command abilities!"},{"title":"Teaching","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to instruct others. If you have Teaching at level 12+, you may act as a teacher for game purposes. For more on teaching and learning, see Improvement Through Study (p. 292)"},{"title":"Teamster","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5, Animal Handling (same)-4, or Riding (same)-2.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"A failure usually means nothing worse than lost time or a wider turn than intended. A critical failure - or any failure at a gallop - spills the wagon or chariot. Treat this as a fiveyard fall for each passenger and animal involved (see Falling, p. 431). As well, roll 2d for each beast; on a 12, a leg is broken! You will have to make Animal Handling rolls to calm the beasts. Time required to reload the cargo depends on the load, terrain, and weather"},{"title":"Thaumatology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","prerequisites":"None.","body":"The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide"},{"title":"Theology","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"IQ-6 or Religious Ritual (same)-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"You do not necessarily believe in the religion you study - faith comes from within, not from book learning! If you do, you may ask the GM to make a secret roll against your Theology skill when confronted with moral uncertainty. On a success, the GM will advise you on which course of action \"feels\" right, given your beliefs and understanding of scripture"},{"title":"Throwing","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"DX-3 or Dropping-4.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to throw any small, relatively smooth object that fits in the palm of your hand. Examples include baseballs, hand grenades, and rocks. (Boomerangs, javelins, knives, etc. require their own specialized skills; see Thrown Weapon, below.) Roll against skill to hit. Furthermore, if you know Throwing at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST when figuring throwing distance (but not damage). Add +2 to ST for Throwing at DX+2 or better"},{"title":"Throwing Art","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"Trained By A Master or Weapon Master.","body":"This is the cinematic ability to throw anything you are strong enough to lift: knives, medicine balls, televisions . . . anything! Roll against skill to hit. Furthermore, if you know Throwing Art at DX level, add +1 to ST when figuring throwing distance, and +1 per die of damage with thrown weapons. These bonuses increase to +2 if you know Throwing Art at DX+1 or better. If you are a Weapon Master, this bonus is instead of the usual damage bonus for your weapon"},{"title":"Thrown Weapon","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"Defaults:","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to hurl any one type of thrown weapon. You must specialize:"},{"title":"Tracking","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Average","defaults":"Perception-5 or Naturalist-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: -5 if the trail is more than a day old, or -10 if more than a week old. +3 if you are following a man, or +6 if following a group of men. Superior senses help a lot: bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) and Discriminatory Smell (p. 49) usually apply, and many superhuman senses (Infravision, Subsonic Hearing, etc.) give situational bonuses."},{"title":"Traps","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","defaults":"IQ-5 or Lockpicking-3*.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: Infinitely variable. The more sophisticated the trap, the harder it will be to disarm, reset, build, or find - and a given trap might be (for instance) easy to find but hard to disarm. The GM should be creative! Equipment modifiers (p. 345) apply to most rolls to set or disarm traps. Bonuses for Acute Vision (p. 35) apply to rolls to detect traps (only)."},{"title":"Typing","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Easy","defaults":"DX-4 and others.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill defaults at -3 to any skill that involves a lot of typing, notably Administration, Computer Operation, Research, and Writing, and Professional Skills such as Journalist. If you have such a skill, Typing skill is redundant (unless you wish to work as a professional typist)"},{"title":"Urban Survival","attribute":"Per","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This talent covers the physical part of staying alive in a city environment, whether it's overpopulated or empty. (The social problems of city survival are covered by Streetwise skill.) A successful skill roll allows you to find clean rainwater; locate manholes from above or below; quickly locate building entrances, exits, stairwells, etc.; recognize and avoid physically dangerous areas, such as crumbling buildings; make and read city maps; find your way out of strange city areas; find a warm place to sleep outside in cold weather; and locate common types of buildings or businesses without asking anyone, just by your \"feel\" for the way cities are laid out"},{"title":"Ventriloquism","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"Modifiers: +5 if you have a dummy or confederate to distract your audience (it's easier to \"see\" a face talk than it is to believe the voice comes from an immobile object); -3 if the audience has reason to be suspicious."},{"title":"Veterinary","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Hard","defaults":"Animal Handling (any)-6, Physician-5, or Surgery-5.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is the ability to care for a sick or wounded animal. You may take an optional specialty (p. 169) in a particular type of animal"},{"title":"Weird Science","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"On a success, you get +5 on an invention attempt (but only +1 if using the Gadgeteer advantage, since Gadgeteer already gives you favorable die rolls for thinking \"outside the box\"). If investigating weird technology, success gives +2 to any skill roll you make for this purpose - and the GM might even allow a default skill roll to operate the device!"},{"title":"Wrestling","attribute":"DX","challenge":"Average","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This skill represents training at grappling and pinning. Roll against the higher of DX or Wrestling to hit with a grapple, or to make or resist a takedown. Furthermore, if you know Wrestling at DX+1 level, add +1 to ST for the purpose of making or resisting any choke, grapple, neck snap, takedown, or pin, and whenever you attempt to break free. Add +2 to ST for Wrestling at DX+2 or better"},{"title":"Writing","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Average","prerequisites":"None.","body":"This is mostly useful to earn a living or write for GURPS, but can sometimes help on adventures . . . or after them. The report of a spy, soldier, or private investigator is far more useful if it is well-written!"},{"title":"Zen Archery","attribute":"IQ","challenge":"Very Hard","defaults":"None.","prerequisites":"Trained By A Master or Weapon Master, Bow at 18+, and Meditation.","body":"Modifiers: -10 if used instantly, dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concentration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4 turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16 turns, and no penalty after 32 turns."}]
